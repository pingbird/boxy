/// The [ParentData] used for [RenderBox] children of [CustomBoxy].
///
/// An unfortunate design decision made on the first release was using
/// the [LayoutId] widget to identify children of the boxy, similar to
/// [CustomMultiChildLayout]. The issue with using [LayoutId] is that it
/// requires the child to have [MultiChildLayoutParentData] which extends
/// [ContainerBoxParentData]<[RenderBox]>, preventing the child from being a
/// [RenderSliver].
///
/// To mitigate this issue we now implement [MultiChildLayoutParentData] on only
/// the [RenderBox] parentData, and recommend users use [BoxyId] instead of
/// [LayoutId].
///
/// Until [LayoutId] support is removed from boxy, the library will fail to
/// compile if/when [MultiChildLayoutParentData] adds any new methods :(
